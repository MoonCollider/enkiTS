## enki Task Scheduler

A permissively licensed C and C++ Task Scheduler for creating parallel programs.

* [C API via src/TaskScheduler_c.h](src/TaskScheduler_c.h)
* [C++ API via src/TaskScheduler.h](src/TaskScheduler.h)
* [C++ 11 version  on Branch C++11](https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiTS/tree/C++11)

Note - this is a work in progress conversion from my code for [enkisoftware](http://www.enkisoftware.com/)'s Avoyd codebase, with [RuntimeCompiledC++](https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus) removed along with the removal of profiling code.

As this was originally written before widespread decent C++11 support for atomics and threads, these are implemented here per-platform supporting Windows, Linux and OSX on Intel x86 / x64 (also works on ARM iOS and Android but not as well tested). [A separate C++11 branch exists](https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiTS/tree/C++11) for those who would like to use it, but this currently has slightly slower performance under very high task throughput when there is low work per task.

The example code requires C++ 11 for chrono (and for [C++ 11 features in the C++11 branch C++11](https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiTS/tree/C++11) )

## Building

Building enkiTS is simple, just add the files in enkiTS/src to your build system (_c.* files can be ignored if you only need C++ interface), and add enkiTS/src to your include path. Unix / Linux builds will require the pthreads library.

For cmake, on Windows / Mac OS X / Linux with cmake installed, open a prompt in the enkiTS directory and:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cmake ..`
3. either run `make` or open `enkiTS.sln`

## Project Features

1. *Lightweight* - enkiTS is designed to be lean so you can use it anywhere easily, and understand it.
1. *Fast, then scalable* - enkiTS is designed for consumer devices first, so performance on a low number of threads is important, followed by scalability.
1. *Braided parallelism* - enkiTS can issue tasks from another task as well as from the thread which created the Task System.
1. *Up-front Allocation friendly* - enkiTS is designed for zero allocations during scheduling.
1. *Can pin tasks to a given thread* - enkiTS can schedule a task which will only be run on the specified thread.
1. **NEW** - *Can set task priorities* - Up to 5 task priorities can be configured via define ENKITS_TASK_PRIORITIES_NUM (defaults to 3). Higher priority tasks are run before lower priority ones.
 
## Usage

C usage:
```C
#include "TaskScheduler_c.h"

enkiTaskScheduler*	g_pTS;

void ParalleTaskSetFunc( uint32_t start_, uint32_t end, uint32_t threadnum_, void* pArgs_ ) {
   /* Do something here, can issue tasks with g_pTS */
}

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
   enkiTaskSet* pTask;
   g_pTS = enkiNewTaskScheduler();
   enkiInitTaskScheduler( g_pTS );
	
   // create a task, can re-use this to get allocation occurring on startup
   pTask	= enkiCreateTaskSet( g_pTS, ParalleTaskSetFunc );

   enkiAddTaskSetToPipe( g_pTS, pTask, NULL, 1); // NULL args, setsize of 1

   // wait for task set (running tasks if they exist) - since we've just added it and it has no range we'll likely run it.
   enkiWaitForTaskSet( g_pTS, pTask );
   
   enkiDeleteTaskSet( pTask );
   
   enkiDeleteTaskScheduler( g_pTS );
   
   return 0;
}
```

C++ usage:
```C
#include "TaskScheduler.h"

enki::TaskScheduler g_TS;

// define a task set, can ignore range if we only do one thing
struct ParallelTaskSet : enki::ITaskSet {
   virtual void    ExecuteRange(  enki::TaskSetPartition range, uint32_t threadnum ) {
      // do something here, can issue tasks with g_TS
   }
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
   g_TS.Initialize();
   ParallelTaskSet task; // default constructor has a set size of 1
   g_TS.AddTaskSetToPipe( &task );

   // wait for task set (running tasks if they exist) - since we've just added it and it has no range we'll likely run it.
   g_TS.WaitforTask( &task );
   return 0;
}
```

C++ 11 usage (currently requires [C++11 branch](https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiTS/tree/C++11), or define own lambda wrapper taskset interface.
```C
#include "TaskScheduler.h"

enki::TaskScheduler g_TS;

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
   g_TS.Initialize();

   enki::TaskSet task( 1, []( enki::TaskSetPartition range, uint32_t threadnum  ) {
         // do something here
      }  );

   g_TS.AddTaskSetToPipe( &task );
   g_TS.WaitforTask( &task );
   return 0;
}
```

Task priorities usage in C++  (see example/Priorities_c.c for C example).
```C
// See full example in Priorities.cpp
#include "TaskScheduler.h"

enki::TaskScheduler g_TS;

struct ExampleTask : enki::ITaskSet
{
    ExampleTask( ) { m_SetSize = size_; }

    virtual void ExecuteRange( enki::TaskSetPartition range, uint32_t threadnum ) {
        // See full example in Priorities.cpp
    }
};


// This example demonstrates how to run a long running task alongside tasks
// which must complete as early as possible using priorities.
int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
    g_TS.Initialize();

    ExampleTask lowPriorityTask( 10 );
    lowPriorityTask.m_Priority  = enki::TASK_PRIORITY_LOW;

    ExampleTask highPriorityTask( 1 );
    highPriorityTask.m_Priority = enki::TASK_PRIORITY_HIGH;

    g_TS.AddTaskSetToPipe( &lowPriorityTask );
    for( int task = 0; task < 10; ++task )
    {
        // run high priority tasks
        g_TS.AddTaskSetToPipe( &highPriorityTask );

        // wait for task but only run tasks of the same priority on this thread
        g_TS.WaitforTask( &highPriorityTask, highPriorityTask.m_Priority );
    }
    // wait for low priority task, run any tasks on this thread whilst waiting
    g_TS.WaitforTask( &lowPriorityTask );

    return 0;
}
```

Pinned Tasks usage in C++ (see example/PinnedTask_c.c for C example).
```C
#include "TaskScheduler.h"

enki::TaskScheduler g_TS;

// define a task set, can ignore range if we only do one thing
struct PinnedTask : enki::IPinnedTask {
    virtual void    Execute() {
      // do something here, can issue tasks with g_TS
   }
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
   g_TS.Initialize();
   PinnedTask task; //default constructor sets thread for pinned task to 0 (main thread)
   g_TS.AddPinnedTask( &task );
   
   // RunPinnedTasks must be called on main thread to run any pinned tasks for that thread.
   // Tasking threads automatically do this in their task loop.
   g_TS.RunPinnedTasks();
   // wait for task set (running tasks if they exist) - since we've just added it and it has no range we'll likely run it.
   g_TS.WaitforTask( &task );
   return 0;
}
```


## Deprecated

The user thread versions are no longer being maintained as they are no longer needed.
* [User thread version  on Branch UserThread](https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiTS/tree/UserThread) for running enkiTS on other tasking / threading systems, so it can be used as in other engines as well as standalone for example.
* [C++ 11 version of user threads on Branch UserThread_C++11](https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiTS/tree/UserThread_C++11)
